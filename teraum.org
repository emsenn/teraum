#+title: Teraum Notes & Plans

* TODO [0/4] Prepare for playtesters
  DEADLINE: <2021-03-21 Sun>
** TODO Plan gameplay
*** Ramblings, 2020/10/08
So my plans for Teraum's gameplay, at the point of playtester release, are basically to have characters with skills, each skill having a list of experiences. Players can do certain things around town based on what skills and experiences they have. doing some things has a chance of unlocking new experiences, but only proper conditions are met: usually, that the character have eaten and drank recently.

Also, players have a pool of energy that almost everything draws from, that recharges over time (or items help recharge it)

Things players can do will include, but obviously won't be limited to:
- shearing sheep
- milking sheep, goats, cows
- collecting eggs
- harvesting flowers, berries, and other plants
- making tea
- weaving cloth

For the playtesting period, I plan on having characers be refugees coming in from the Unseen Sea.

I know this doesn't sound like much gameplay, just variations on "harvest and craft," but for now I think that's enough: it'll let me focus on worldbuilding, and then explore what gameplay should come next with the playtesters.
