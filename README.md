# Teraum
*A tragically funny fantasy world*

***Teraum*** is an online multi-player role-playing game with a text-interface:

```
> look
[  murky swamp  ]
Trees and cattails compete for space in the brackish water.
  Exits: south
> move south
You move south, to: desolate village
  Exits: north, south
> look
[  desolate village  ]
Small buildings, basically sheaves of cattail leaves on stilts, are
gathered together here. There's no one around.
  Exits: north, south
```

Right now the game is in early development.
